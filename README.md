2-FAST
======

The 2-FAST (2-point function from Fast and Accurate Spherical bessel Transform)
algorithm is implemented here in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming
language.

The algorithm is documented in our paper [2-FAST: Fast and Accurate Computation of Projected Two-point functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02401)

Minimal examples are given in the file `Julia/twofast_example.jl`.
